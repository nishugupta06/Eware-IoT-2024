Motivation
The workshop on Energy Aware-IoT based on Mobile Networks (Eware-IoT) aims to provide a forum for sharing ideas and explore the latest advances in the areas contributing towards the optimization of IoT applications and devices from energy awareness perspective (consumption production and storage) in wireless 5G/6G systems; and Integration and application of Energy Aware-IoT with MEC, ML, big data, AI, DRL and other technologies. This workshop is aimed at researchers, industry professionals, regulators, policy makers and students passionate about the convergence of Energy usage in Mobile Radio Access Networks using the Machine Learning, the Internet of Things and energy aware data analysis. We encourage participation from those looking to explore collaboration opportunities and help shape a connected, energy-driven future. All unpublished, original papers addressing all aspects related to the development and adoption of the Energy Aware-Internet of Things are invited.
Organization and Format
Description of the intended organization:
In the proposed one-day workshop, we expect around 30 people, but attendance will not be restricted. The planned schedule of the workshop will start with a keynote presentation, followed by the presentation of a maximum of 10 full papers and 10 short papers in two sessions. Interactive activities during the Workshop will focus on sharing, ideas, and concerns surrounding the optimization of IoT applications and devices from energy awareness perspective in wireless 5G/6G systems in a moderated discussion to capture the diversity of interests and perspective of participants. A full outline of the workshop agenda is presented in Table 1.
Selection process for the contributors:
Papers not exceeding 8 double-column pages, including figures must be submitted via Easy- Chair, written in English, and contain original material that has not been published or is currently undergoing review elsewhere. Papers must use the new ACM article template (when using the overleaf ACM template, choose the sample-sigconf.tex file). Accepted full papers will be presented during the workshop in 8 min presentation + 2 min Q&A style. Short papers (up to 2 pages) are encouraged to report novel and creative ideas that are yet to produce concrete research results but are at a stage where community feedback would be useful. Accepted short papers will be presented at the Workshop as One-slide pitches. Papers will be peer-reviewed by at least two experts following a double-blind review process (therefore, the submissions should be anonymized). The reviewers will evaluate the novelty and originality of the research, assess the degree of innovation in addressing challenges or presenting new concepts, determine the significance of the research contribution to the broader field and analyse the potential impact on advancing knowledge or practical applications. Based on the review comments a decision would be made and conveyed to the contributors. Accepted papers will be invited to the workshop and will be included in the ACM Digital Library and supplemental proceedings of the conference. All papers will be digitally available through the workshop website. At least one author of an accepted submission must attend the workshop. Organizers will document the outcomes of the workshop and make this information available to all participants through a shared cloud folder.
